## Sample Test Cases and Test Scenarios
The attached PNG files contain sample Test Cases and Test Scenarios for a mobile application.

Descriptions:
ðŸ“Œ Test Case with Application of BVA and EP
- This test case applies a combination of Black Box Testing techniques: Boundary Value Analysis (BVA) and Equivalence Partitioning (EP).
- These techniques help ensure that invalid values are properly rejected while valid inputs are accepted, improving test coverage and reliability.

ðŸ“Œ Test Case for Login Functionality
- A sample Login Test Case designed to verify the correctness of the login process.
- It includes test conditions for valid and invalid credentials, error messages, and security measures such as account lockout after multiple failed attempts.

ðŸ“Œ Test Scenarios for Data Integrity Testing
This section covers Data Integrity Test Scenarios to ensure that:
- Data is correctly captured, stored, and retrieved without inconsistencies.
- Input validations prevent incorrect or duplicate data entries.
- System behavior remains consistent when handling database operations, form submissions, and data updates.

These test cases and scenarios demonstrate my expertise in software testing methodologies and quality assurance practices.
